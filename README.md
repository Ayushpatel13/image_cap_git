# Image Captioning
Image Captioning is an encoder decoder mode based on sequence to sequence learning. It takes a image as input and generates a caption describing the event in the image.

## Applications of image captioning

* *Probably, will be useful in cases/fields where text is most used and with the use of this, you can infer/generate text from images. As in, use the information directly from any 
particular image in a textual format automatically.*

* *There are many NLP applications right now, which extract insights/summary from a given text data or an essay etc. The same benefits can be obtained by people who would benefit from automated insights from images.*

* *A slightly (not-so) long term use case would definitely be, explaining what happens in a video, frame by frame.*

* *Would serve as a huge help for visually impaired people. Lots of applications can be developed in that space.*

* *Social Media Platforms like facebook can infer directly from the image, where you are ( beach, cafe etc), what you wear (color) and more importantly what youâ€™re doing also (in a way). See an example to understand it better.*
